2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/ENET0_GMII_RXD_i_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/ENET0_GMII_RXD_i_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/ENET0_GMII_RXD_i_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning

The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/ENET0_GMII_RXD_i_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/ENET0_GMII_RX_DV_i_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/ENET0_GMII_TXD_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/ENET0_GMII_TXD_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/ENET0_GMII_TXD_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/ENET0_GMII_TXD_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#11 Critical Warning

The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/ENET0_GMII_TX_EN_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#12 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/PS7_i/EMIOENET0GMIIRXCLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#13 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/processing_system7_0/inst/PS7_i/EMIOENET0GMIITXCLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net ENET0_GMII_RX_CLK_0_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): ENET0_GMII_RX_CLK_0_IBUF_inst/O, design_1_i/ENET0_GMII_RX_CLK_0
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#2 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net ENET0_GMII_TX_CLK_0_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): ENET0_GMII_TX_CLK_0_IBUF_inst/O, design_1_i/ENET0_GMII_TX_CLK_0
Related violations: <none>
