WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 computer/ram1/mem_reg_0_0 has an input control pin computer/ram1/mem_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[9] (net: computer/ram1/ADDRBWRADDR[9]) which is driven by a register (computer/cpu1/u0/A_reg[9]_rep__0) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
